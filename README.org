#+TITLE: A bottom-up approach to live coding based on continuous gestural interactions

* How to execute the code
- The classes should be moved (or linked) to the folder =Platform.userExtensionDir=
- Recompile SC class library =thisProcess.recompile=
- Run the script =generate-data.scd=
  + STEP 1: Generate sequential data
  + STEP 2:
    * Plot the generated token sequences in a coded decimal representation  (see method tokensProba in the class TokenRecognition)
    * Plot the histograms for these sequences
  + STEP 3: Calculate paired correlations (should be done as QQ-plots)
  + STEP 4: Explore the generated data
